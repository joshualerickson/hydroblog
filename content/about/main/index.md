intro: |
  hydroblog is meant to have open thoughts and discussions within the field of hydrology. Sometimes it can be difficult to have a nuanced idea or thought in a very comprehensive field like hydrology or just trying to understand some complex subject matter. This site is meant to break that! My goal is to show that you can continue to grow and learn in whatever discipline you're interested in by continual learning and open source material.
