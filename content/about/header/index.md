  Hi, welcome to hydroblog!

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
Thanks for visiting! My name is Josh Erickson and I live in Eureka, MT. I'm a hydrologist with the USDA-USFS and have a BS in Geoscience and minor in Math from The University of Montana. I like to blog about hydrology, remote sensing and statistics content. I'm seriously addicted to learning, so please reach out if you have any thoughts or ideas for this platform, e.g. examples, topics, comments, etc. I'm also married to my lovely wife Mandy, who is the best! We have a 9 year old fur-baby named Marley. Love to nerd out but also get lost in the mountains of the inland northwest (Canada included).
