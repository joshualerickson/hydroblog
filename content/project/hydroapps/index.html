<p>The goal of {hydroapps} is to to create apps for resource management in the context of hydrology monitoring and reporting. This package relies heavily on <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/products/data-and-tools/apis">USGS API</a> and wouldnâ€™t be possible with out it (much thanks). However, this package is highly experimental and is used mostly by myself but I think itâ€™s worth sharing! Please enjoy and contributions are welcome!</p>
<div id="goals" class="section level2">
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>As of <strong>08/07/2021</strong> the app is functional. Things to work on:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>water year and year confusion or ability to make it usable. Right now it uses a weird combo of bothâ€¦. Not the best ðŸ¤·</p></li>
<li><p>cleaning up code structure and repeating code (especially in â€˜usgs_statsâ€™).</p></li>
<li><p>reduce package dependencies.</p></li>
<li><p>Any ideas? Please let me know!</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="installation" class="section level2">
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>This is only in development right now.</p>
<p>And the development version from <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> with:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;)
devtools::install_github(&quot;joshualerickson/hydroapps&quot;)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="contributions" class="section level2">
<h2>Contributions</h2>
<p>This package uses the <a href="https://github.com/ThinkR-open/golem">golem</a> framework and thus uses modules to bring everything together. If you want to help contribute please be aware of this framework, i.e.Â see <a href="https://engineering-shiny.org/golem.html">here</a> for more details. Other than that, contributions are welcomed!</p>

<div id="basic-example" class="section level2">
<h2>Basic Example</h2>
<p>As of right now there are two app options: â€˜streamstatsâ€™ or â€˜usgs_statsâ€™. Just enter the character string into the <code>run_app()</code> and run the app. â€˜streamstatsâ€™ is a play on the <a href="https://streamstats.usgs.gov/ss/">USGS StreamStats Application</a> and also has some commonly used metrics for estimated culvert sizes. â€˜usgs_statsâ€™ lets the user select either historic or current stations and get a quick idea of the current daily value as well as a station hydrograph, baseflow index (BFI), flood frequency and time series of maximum flows. In addition, â€˜usgs_statsâ€™ includes filters to change the year and months; however, it is important to not that the maximum flows will only use the daily mean maximum if the month is filtered, i.e.Â maximum flow uses dataRetrieval::readNWISpeak() when months are 1:12 and wildlandhydRo::wymUSGS() otherwise.</p>
