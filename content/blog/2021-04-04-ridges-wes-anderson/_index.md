  title: What are ridge plots?
  author: Josh Erickson
  description: "Ridge plots or ridgeline plots are a way to express the distribution of the data for some categorical variable. This is very similar to a violin plot for box-plots. This helps to see bimodal characteristics better or tailedness of the distribution (see graph above) and is also more intuitive for the reader."
