  title: What are descriptive statistics?
  author: Josh Erickson
  description: "Descriptive statistics are expressions of summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, etc) from a sample of data. These are crucial for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and help the user frame the sample relatively quickly. Like in the graph above we can see that the data is normally distributed but the kurtosis is different. "
