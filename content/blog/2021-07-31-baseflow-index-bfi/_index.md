  title: What is  baseflow?
  author: -Singh, Shailesh Kumar, et al (2019)
  description: "Streamflow is typically divided into two components for hydrograph separation, quickflow and baseflow. Baseflow is the portion of streamflow that contains groundwater flow and flow from other delayed sources and is of key importance for river basin ecology and water resources planning and management. The BaseFlow Index (BFI) is defined as the ratio of long-term mean baseflow to total streamflow."
