  description: "'One step at a time' is a phrase I say a lot to myself when I dive into complex topics and subject matter. It helps me come back to the moment and remember that this is a marathon not a sprint. It takes time. So, let's help each other one step at a time!"

** No content below YAML for the blog _index. This file provides front matter for the listing page layout and sidebar content. It is also a branch bundle, and all settings under `cascade` provide front matter for all pages inside blog/. You may still override any of these by changing them in a page's front matter.**
