      <description>hydroappsThe goal of {hydroapps} is to to create apps for resource management in the context of hydrology monitoring and reporting. This package relies heavily on USGS API and wouldn’t be possible with out it (much thanks). However, this package is highly experimental and is used mostly by myself but I think it’s worth sharing! Please enjoy and contributions are welcome!
GoalsAs of 08/07/2021 the app is functional.</description>
