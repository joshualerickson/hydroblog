      <description>Zonal StatisticsThis is a quick workflow using some rasters, polygons, and a few packages in R that iâ€™ve used for a couple analysis recently. The main purpose of this workflow is to show the code used and how to get some simple zonal statistics in R and explore them relatively easy. Thus, there will be a lot of code! If you take anything out of this I hope it would be that zonal statistics in R are pretty awesome right now.</description>
