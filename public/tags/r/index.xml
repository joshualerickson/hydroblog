      <description>IntroGet DataRaster GraphHysteresis3D SpaghettiConclusionReferencesIntro{whitewater} was originally developed for parallel processing but has always had some data wrangling and transformations sugar that can help visualize USGS NWIS data effectively. In this post we’ll use the advantages of {whitewater} to look at a site graphically a few different ways (tiled, hysteresis, 3D spaghetti).
Get DataLet’s load the packages. We’ll use {ggfx} to give it an extra effects but you don’t necessarily need it.</description>

      <title>hydroapps is a package that runs hydrological shiny apps</title>

      <description>hydroappsThe goal of {hydroapps} is to to create apps for resource management in the context of hydrology monitoring and reporting. This package relies heavily on USGS API and wouldn’t be possible with out it (much thanks). However, this package is highly experimental and is used mostly by myself but I think it’s worth sharing! Please enjoy and contributions are welcome!
GoalsAs of 08/07/2021 the app is functional. Things to work on:</description>

      <title>wildlandhydRo is a package that leverages USGS and SNOTEL APIs.</title>

      <description>IntroThe goal of wildlandhydRo is to create wrapper functions around commonly used packages like streamstats, snotelr and dataRetrieval and prepare them for chunk-based parallelism, data munging and reporting. Basically, a package for me but worth sharing with others.
InstallationYou can install the development version from GitHub with:
# install.packages(&amp;quot;devtools&amp;quot;)devtools::install_github(&amp;quot;joshualerickson/wildlandhydRo&amp;quot;)ExamplesBelow are some common examples that I routinely use with the package.
ParallelWith {wildlandhydRo} it is really easy to get station data in parallel.</description>

      <description>exploreRGEEThe goal of exploreRGEE is to explore Google Earth Engine (GEE) in the Rstudio IDE. This package uses bindings and functions from rgee and other spatial packages (sf, leaflet) to explore Google Earth Engine collections relatively quickly while using R. This package is meant to be exploratory and experimental but also provides the user quick functions to reproducible tasks, e.g. repetitive workflows. The reason for doing this inR is that some people are not familiar with JavaScript or Python but versed in R and this provides easy access to use GEE with commonly used methods for exploratory data analysis (tidyverse).</description>
