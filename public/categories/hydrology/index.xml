      <description>hydroappsThe goal of {hydroapps} is to to create apps for resource management in the context of hydrology monitoring and reporting. This package relies heavily on USGS API and wouldn’t be possible with out it (much thanks). However, this package is highly experimental and is used mostly by myself but I think it’s worth sharing! Please enjoy and contributions are welcome!
GoalsAs of 08/07/2021 the app is functional.</description>

      <description>IntroThe goal of wildlandhydRo is to create wrapper functions around commonly used packages like streamstats, snotelr and dataRetrieval and prepare them for chunk-based parallelism, data munging and reporting. Basically, a package for me but worth sharing with others.
InstallationYou can install the development version from GitHub with:
# install.packages(&amp;quot;devtools&amp;quot;)devtools::install_github(&amp;quot;joshualerickson/wildlandhydRo&amp;quot;)ExamplesBelow are some common examples that I routinely use with the package.
ParallelWith {wildlandhydRo} it is really easy to get station data in parallel.</description>
