      <description>About My name is Josh Erickson and I live in Eureka, MT. I&amp;rsquo;m a hydrologist and married to my lovely wife Mandy, who is the best! We have a 8 year old fur-baby named marley (see below). I like to nerd out on stats, math and environmental sciences but also get out in the woods and get lost.</description>
