      <description>So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve been leveraging GitHub Pages for publishing. This works great, but for blogdown we&amp;rsquo;ll start using Netlify. Let&amp;rsquo;s start RIGHT NOW with a site we&amp;rsquo;ve already built and published.
Pre-requisites     Pick either your postcards site, or your distill site from day 01. Refresh your memory- which repository was it again?</description>

      <description>Welcome to the Introducing Yourself Online workshop! We look forward to meeting you. Before attending the workshop, please complete the following prework.
Set up RStudio Cloud     Sign up for a free RStudio Cloud account at https://rstudio.cloud/ before the workshop. I recommend logging in with an existing Google or GitHub account, if you have one (rather than creating a new account with another password you have to remember).</description>

      <title>hydroapps is a package that runs hydrological shiny apps</title>
      <link>https://hydroblog.netlify.com/project/hydroapps/</link>

      <guid>https://hydroblog.netlify.com/project/hydroapps/</guid>
      <description>hydroappsThe goal of {hydroapps} is to to create apps for resource management in the context of hydrology monitoring and reporting. This package relies heavily on USGS API and wouldn’t be possible with out it (much thanks). However, this package is highly experimental and is used mostly by myself but I think it’s worth sharing! Please enjoy and contributions are welcome!
GoalsAs of 08/07/2021 the app is functional.</description>

      <title>wildlandhydRo is a package that leverages USGS and SNOTEL APIs.</title>
      <link>https://hydroblog.netlify.com/project/wildlandhydro/</link>

      <guid>https://hydroblog.netlify.com/project/wildlandhydro/</guid>
      <description>IntroThe goal of wildlandhydRo is to create wrapper functions around commonly used packages like streamstats, snotelr and dataRetrieval and prepare them for chunk-based parallelism, data munging and reporting. Basically, a package for me but worth sharing with others.
InstallationYou can install the development version from GitHub with:
# install.packages(&amp;quot;devtools&amp;quot;)devtools::install_github(&amp;quot;joshualerickson/wildlandhydRo&amp;quot;)ExamplesBelow are some common examples that I routinely use with the package.
ParallelWith {wildlandhydRo} it is really easy to get station data in parallel.</description>

      <description>exploreRGEEThe goal of exploreRGEE is to explore Google Earth Engine (GEE) in the Rstudio IDE. This package uses bindings and functions from rgee and other spatial packages (sf, leaflet) to explore Google Earth Engine collections relatively quickly while using R. This package is meant to be exploratory and experimental but also provides the user quick functions to reproducible tasks, e.g. repetitive workflows. The reason for doing this inR is that some people are not familiar with JavaScript or Python but versed in R and this provides easy access to use GEE with commonly used methods for exploratory data analysis (tidyverse).</description>

      <title>Spatial Holdouts and Feature Selection</title>
      <link>https://hydroblog.netlify.com/blog/2021-03-11-spatial-holdouts-and-feature-selection/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 11 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://hydroblog.netlify.com/blog/2021-03-11-spatial-holdouts-and-feature-selection/</guid>
      <description>Findings
Both model types (gbm and random forest) are very sensitive when using all variables and no spatial hold-outs; however, when increasing the hold out size (iid becomes more appropriate) we see that random forest takes some time before it stabilizes unlike gbm which is able to control for that effect early on.
FFS variable selection at cluster holdout 10 was 9 variables while the new variable selection (unnamed) used only 5 variables at a cluster holdout of 10 while keeping the same accuracy; making the model more parsimonious.</description>

      <description>IntroductionBelow is a workflow used to create a forest change raster (2011-2019) for the Watershed Condition Class (WCC) analysis in USDA-USFS Region 1. The workflow leverages Google Earth Engine (GEE) (Gorelick et al. 2017) to get large remote sensing products fast and easy. This allows for reproducibility in the future as well as quick return times for clients, i.</description>

Moving objects   Technically, you can create your own folders via some (above my head) method but I&amp;rsquo;ll just default to using the UI on GCS. From there, you can then start to move files that you&amp;rsquo;ve uploaded via desktop, R, earth engine, etc.</description>

      <description>This is the quick rundown on the rgee package that is pretty dope. The r-spatial folks have thrown down some sweet packages sf, stars, mapview (just to name a few) and now rgee. This is some pretty slick stuff. If your versed in JavaScript (JS) and wonder ‘should I waste my time with this API interface?’. Don’t worry. I’m not going to try and convince you to be a ‘R’ person just showing some of the basics and capabilities of using GEE R.</description>

      <description>This is a quick peek into the perks of using R and USGS package dataRetrieval. This package is pretty slick and has a lot of functions associated with it. We will just look into some basic functions like readNWISdv to get some USGS gauging data and then do some quick exploratory data analysis to using the tidyverse.
First, load the packages (or install) from the library().

      <description>Over the next month I’m going to be posting some quick examples from a few R packages that I’ve stumbled into. One is the dataRetrieval package by USGS. In short, it let’s you download any gauging station data across the country right into R and in a tidy format. How sweet is that? USGS also has other packages like the suite of smwr packages. These packages provide the user with some commonly used (but often tedious) functions used in hydrology, e.</description>

      <description>Zonal StatisticsThis is a quick workflow using some rasters, polygons, and a few packages in R that i’ve used for a couple analysis recently. The main purpose of this workflow is to show the code used and how to get some simple zonal statistics in R and explore them relatively easy. Thus, there will be a lot of code! If you take anything out of this I hope it would be that zonal statistics in R are pretty awesome right now.</description>
