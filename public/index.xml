      <description>Zonal StatisticsThis is a quick workflow using some rasters, polygons, and a few packages in R that iâ€™ve used for a couple analysis recently. The main purpose of this workflow is to show the code used and how to get some simple zonal statistics in R and explore them relatively easy. Thus, there will be a lot of code! If you take anything out of this I hope it would be that zonal statistics in R are pretty awesome right now.</description>

      <description>This is an attempt to make hydrology topics and workflows available to whomever. There will be a couple different resources you can look at: blog and projects. Blog is a brief rant, discussion, or workflow that will be relatively short. As you can imagine, projects resource it will be the very tedious, dense, copious, and downright exaustive workflows. Please keep an open mind as this might get very pedantic at times while also being very domain adjacent!</description>

      <description>About My name is Josh Erickson and I live in Eureka, MT. I&amp;rsquo;m a hydrologist for the USDA Forest Service and am married to my lovely wife Mandy who is super beauitiful, kind, caring, and patient. I decided to write a blog so that discussions may form and also to provide some of the content I&amp;rsquo;m using on a day-to-day basis with R. Hopefully you enjoy.</description>
