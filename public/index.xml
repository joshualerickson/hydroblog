      <description>This is the quick rundown on the rgee package that is pretty dope. The r-spatial folks have thrown down some sweet packages sf, stars, mapview (just to name a few of many) and now rgee. This is some pretty slick stuff. If your versed in JavaScript (JS) and wonder ‘should I waste my time with this API interface?’, then don’t worry I’m not going to try and convince you just showing some of the basics.</description>

      <description>This is a quick peek into the perks of using R and USGS package dataRetrieval. This package is pretty slick and has a lot of functions associated with it. We will just look into some basic functions like readNWISdv to get some USGS gauging data and then do some quick exploratory data analysis to using the tidyverse.
First, load the packages (or install) from the library().
library(dataRetrieval)library(tidyverse)Now we can start bringing in some river data.</description>

      <description>Over the next month I’m going to be posting some quick examples from a few R packages that I’ve stumbled into. One is the dataRetrieval package by USGS. In short, it let’s you download any gauging station data across the country right into R and in a tidy format. How sweet is that? USGS also has other packages like the suite of smwr packages. These packages provide the user with some commonly used (but often tedious) functions used in hydrology, e.</description>

      <description>Zonal StatisticsThis is a quick workflow using some rasters, polygons, and a few packages in R that i’ve used for a couple analysis recently. The main purpose of this workflow is to show the code used and how to get some simple zonal statistics in R and explore them relatively easy. Thus, there will be a lot of code! If you take anything out of this I hope it would be that zonal statistics in R are pretty awesome right now.</description>

      <description>This is an attempt to make hydrology topics and workflows available to whomever. There will be a couple different resources you can look at: blog and projects. Blog is a brief rant, discussion, or workflow that will be relatively short. As you can imagine, projects resource it will be the very tedious, dense, copious, and downright exaustive workflows. Please keep an open mind as this might get very pedantic at times while also being very domain adjacent!</description>

      <description>About My name is Josh Erickson and I live in Eureka, MT. I&amp;rsquo;m a hydrologist and married to my lovely wife Mandy, who is the best! We have a 8 year old fur-baby named marley (see below). I like to nerd out on stats, math and environmental sciences but also get out in the woods and get lost.</description>
